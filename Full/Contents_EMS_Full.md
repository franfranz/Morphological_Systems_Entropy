#### Data 
* Language Resources used in the study (from Itwac and Morph-it!) [(wd0)](https://github.com/franfranz/Morphological_Systems_Entropy/tree/main/Full/wd0).
* Merged dataset with all nouns, animate sample, control sample [(wd1)](https://github.com/franfranz/Morphological_Systems_Entropy/tree/main/Full/wd1).
* Text files collecting the 10-word-windows surrounding the words in the animate and control sample, collected from the Itwac corpus [(wd2)](https://github.com/franfranz/Morphological_Systems_Entropy/tree/main/Full/wd2). Please note that this folder only contains a mini sample of nouns. The full dataset is available on request
* Datasets of animate sample and control sample, with Context Entropy measures [(wd3)](https://github.com/franfranz/Morphological_Systems_Entropy/tree/main/Full/wd3).
